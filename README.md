Implement a DevOps pipeline in a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS

A cluster was deployed on both Ubuntu (Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS) and Red Hat (Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.0 - Ootpa) running on AWS. The setup and installation steps were similar for both clusters each consisting of the deployment VM (t2.micro), a master (c4.large), and 2 nodes (t2.medium)
